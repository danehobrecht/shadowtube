I would say pistons to push you back, but that would require a lot more because of visibility reasons and instead of just a blank background, you should put some characters. It would take a lot for the movements and having the arrows at the same time but it’s worth it for sure. If the second one is too hard then you can just do the first one, because I don’t mind lack of cosmetics over playability"}
