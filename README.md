## Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/tmuq/shadowtube.git && cd shadowtube
```
2. Install dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. [Configure torrc](#configure-torrc) (optional)
4. Launch an instance of Tor Browser
5. Execute 
```
python3 shadowtube.py
```
## Configure torrc
1. Hash a custom control password
```
tor --hash-password <password>
```
2. Open `torrc` with elevated privelages
```
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
```
3. Append the hashed password to `HashedControlPassword` and uncomment `ControlPort`
```
...
## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
ControlPort 9151
## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.
HashedControlPassword 16:872860B76453A77D60CA2BB8C1A7042072093276A3D701AD684053EC4C
#CookieAuthentication 1
...
```
### Additional security steps
To prevent unauthorized users from accessing `tor`, consider adding the following steps:
- Change your SOCKS5 and control ports to a port not commonly used
- **Important for users using cookie authentication**: Append the following lines to `torrc`
```
SocksPolicy accept 127.0.0.1
SocksPolicy reject *
```
This step limits connection only to the local loopback address, effectively limiting connections originating from the local machine.
